# Olas Memory Leak Analysis Report

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Missing `[weak self]` in Closures and Timers
**Severity: HIGH**

The codebase has very minimal usage of `[weak self]` in closures (only 7 occurrences across 3 files), which is a major red flag for memory leaks in iOS apps.

#### Affected Areas:
- **Timer implementations without weak self:**
  - `OnboardingView.swift:446` - Timer.scheduledTimer without weak reference
  - `StoriesView.swift:419` - Timer.scheduledTimer without weak reference
  - `OlasStoriesView.swift:440` - Timer.scheduledTimer without weak reference
  - `OlasCameraView.swift:213` - Timer.scheduledTimer without weak reference

- **Task closures without weak self:**
  - `AuthenticationView.swift:84` - Task closure captures self strongly
  - `CreateAccountView.swift:102` - Task closure captures self strongly
  - `CreatePostView.swift:107` - Task closure captures self strongly
  - `AppState.swift:36` - Task with while loop that could retain self indefinitely

### 2. Observable Objects with Strong References
**Severity: MEDIUM**

Several manager classes are `ObservableObject` that may create retain cycles:
- `OlasWalletManager` - References `NostrManager` without weak
- `NostrManager` - Contains multiple strong references to data sources
- `AppState` - Has weak reference to NostrManager (good) but contains infinite loop Task

### 3. Missing deinit Implementations
**Severity: MEDIUM**

Only 1 class (`StoriesManager`) has a deinit implementation. Missing deinit in manager classes means we can't verify proper cleanup of resources.

### 4. Data Source Observations
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The `UserProfileDataSource` and other data sources use Combine's `assign(to:)` which can create retain cycles:
```swift
dataSource.$data
    .map { ... }
    .assign(to: &$posts)  // Potential retain cycle
```

### 5. Continuous Observation Loops
**Severity: HIGH**

`AppState.swift:36-47` contains an infinite while loop that observes authentication state:
```swift
while true {
    withObservationTracking { ... }
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000)
}
```
This Task is never cancelled and will run indefinitely.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Add `[weak self]` to all Timer closures:**
```swift
timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.05, repeats: true) { [weak self] _ in
    guard let self = self else { return }
    // ... rest of code
}
```

2. **Add `[weak self]` to all Task closures:**
```swift
Task { [weak self] in
    guard let self = self else { return }
    // ... rest of code
}
```

3. **Replace infinite loops with proper observation patterns:**
   - Use Combine publishers or async sequences
   - Ensure proper cancellation on deinit

4. **Add deinit to all manager classes to verify cleanup:**
```swift
deinit {
    timer?.invalidate()
    task?.cancel()
    // Log to verify deallocation
    print("\(Self.self) deallocated")
}
```

5. **Use `sink` instead of `assign(to:)` with proper cancellation:**
```swift
private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

dataSource.$data
    .map { ... }
    .sink { [weak self] posts in
        self?.posts = posts
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

### Memory Leak Patterns to Fix:

1. **Timer Pattern:**
   - All Timer.scheduledTimer calls need weak self
   - Timers must be invalidated in deinit or cleanup methods

2. **Task Pattern:**
   - All Task { } closures need weak self
   - Tasks should be stored and cancelled on cleanup

3. **Observation Pattern:**
   - Replace infinite loops with cancellable observations
   - Use weak self in all observation closures

4. **Manager Pattern:**
   - Add proper cleanup in deinit
   - Use weak references for cross-manager dependencies

## Testing Recommendations

1. Use Xcode's Memory Graph Debugger to verify objects are deallocated
2. Add memory leak tests using XCTest's memory tracking
3. Monitor memory usage during navigation between views
4. Test timer cleanup when views disappear

## Conclusion

The codebase has significant memory leak risks due to missing weak references in closures, timers without proper cleanup, and infinite observation loops. These issues should be addressed immediately to prevent memory accumulation and potential app crashes.
